/* ############### WONKY COINS
Catsylvanian money is a strange thing: they have a coin for every
denomination (including zero!). A wonky change machine in
Catsylvania takes any coin of value N and returns 3 new coins,
valued at N/2, N/3 and N/4 (rounding down).

Write a method that returns the number of coins you
are left with if you take all non-zero coins and keep feeding them
back into the machine until you are left with only zero-value coins.
