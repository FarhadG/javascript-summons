/* ############### RECTANGLE INTERSECTION
Write a function that returns the
intersection of the two rectangles.

Rectangles are represented as a pair of coordinate-pairs: the
bottom-left and top-right coordinates (given in `[x, y]` notation).

Hint: You can calculate the left-most x coordinate of the
intersection by taking the maximum of the left-most x coordinate of
each rectangle. Likewise, you can calculate the top-most y
coordinate of the intersection by taking the minimum of the top most
y coordinate of each rectangle.
