/* ############### CHANGE BASE

Write a method that converts a number from one base to a different base.
It should work for bases up to 16 (hexadecimal).

For example, to convert 4 from base 10 to base 2,
we would run the following: changeBase(4, 10, 2) === 100
Or 16 from base 10 to 16:   changeBase(1234, 10, 16) === 4D2
