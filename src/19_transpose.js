/*--TRANSPOSE

  To represent a matrix, or two-dimensional grid of numbers, we can write an array containing arrays which represent rows:

    var rows = [[0, 1, 2],
                [3, 4, 5],
                [6, 7, 8]]

  Write a method that will convert between the row-oriented and column-oriented representations.

  For example: transpose(rows) ===  [[0, 3, 6],
                                     [1, 4, 7],
                                     [2, 5, 8]]
*/

var transpose;

transpose = function(arr) {
  return "summon here";
};
