/*--FISHER-YATES SHUFFLE

  Write a function that takes an array and shuffles the
  elements using the "Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle" methodology.

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher-Yates_shuffle
  
  1) Write down the numbers from 1 to N.
  2) Pick a random number k between one and the number of unstruck numbers remaining (inclusive).
  3) Counting from the low end, strike out the kth number not yet struck out, and write it down elsewhere.
  4) Repeat from step 2 until all the numbers have been struck out.
  5) The sequence of numbers written down in step 3 is now a random permutation of the original numbers.
