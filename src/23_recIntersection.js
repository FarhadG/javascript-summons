/*--RECTANGLE INTERSECTION

  Write a function that returns the
  intersection of the two rectangles.

  Rectangles are represented as a pair of coordinate-pairs: the
  bottom-left and top-right coordinates (given in `[x, y]` notation).

  Hint: You can calculate the left-most x coordinate of the
  intersection by taking the maximum of the left-most x coordinate of
  each rectangle. Likewise, you can calculate the top-most y
  coordinate of the intersection by taking the minimum of the top most
  y coordinate of each rectangle.

  For example: recIntersection([[0, 0], [2, 1]],
                               [[1, 0], [3, 1]]) returns [[1, 0], [2, 1]]
*/

var recIntersection;

recIntersection = function(rec1, rec2) {
  return "summon here";
};
