/*--CAESAR CIPHER

  Implement your own Caesar cipher.

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher

  In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, 
  the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest 
  and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution 
  cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter 
  some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a 
  left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.

  For example: caesar("hello", 3) returns "khoor"

  HINT: You can either map letters to numbers or use the ASCII codes.
