/*--BUBBLE SORT

  Write a function that sorts an array of integers 
  using the "Bubble Sort" methodology.

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort

  "Bubble sort, sometimes incorrectly referred to as sinking sort, 
  is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping 
  through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items 
  and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the 
  list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the 
  list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements 
  "bubble" to the top of the list. Because it only uses comparisons to 
  operate on elements, it is a comparison sort."

var bubbleSort;

bubbleSort = function(arr) {
  return "summon here";
};
